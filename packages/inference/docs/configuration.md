# Configuration

The configuration schema lives in `src/schemas/config.ts`; resolution and runtime
state live in their neighboring configuration and runtime modules. The SDK consumes
the exported inference surface rather than maintaining an independent schema.

- Resolve and validate configuration before exposing it to handlers.
- Keep runtime configuration immutable unless a public API explicitly defines a
  reload operation.
- Add a field to its schema, resolved state, public type surface, and focused tests
  together.
- Use cross-platform path and environment handling compatible with Bare and the SDK
  hosts.
- Never put credentials or machine-specific values in committed defaults or
  examples.

Read the current source before documenting defaults; configuration fields and
defaults are intentionally not duplicated here.
